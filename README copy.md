## Description

Aside the initial assignment we wanted to go on and do a little extra project in which we used the skills we had been building up to gain more experience. The reason we made this project is to show that we can automate any file (including excel files) to our advantage and embed them in any programmable platform, which in our case, we did it as a Website. This Website is made using Flask and the automation and processing used up libraries like Pandas, Openpyxl and Matplotlib.

## Installation

```bash
cd IT-Assignment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
# The app will then be hosted on localhost port 5000
```
